## How to Launch Our Application

**Important:** Ensure you have downloaded Python 3. Versions earlier than Python 3 are not compatible. We fully support Python 3 to 3.9.

**Step 1:** Download the PySide2 module:
- Execute the command `pip install pyside2` in your terminal.

### Method 1:

The easiest way to launch our application is to open the `Launcher.py` file in the main directory, then open it in Python IDLE. Once opened, press the F5 key on your keyboard to start the application.

### Method 2:

You can also right-click on the `Launcher.py` file, select "Open with," and then choose Python.

## Notes

- Only the back buttons on the two main windows ("Manage My Accounts" and "Manage My Budgets") save the information added to accounts.
- It is recommended that you download the fonts from the Fonts folder (`.../Projet_INFO/Polices`) to avoid display issues.
- The `.ui` files are XML files for the graphical interface. Do not modify them! Similarly, avoid altering other `.py` files to prevent corruption.
